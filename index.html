                  &emsp;I am a recent graduate from the University of Colorado Denver. I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering and a certification in Cybersecurity and Secure Computing. During my time in school I explored many areas of computer science such as <span class="bold-text">Web Development, Data Analysis, Video Game Design, Artificial Intelligence, and Cybersecurity</span>. I have gained and learned knowledge on several concepts and I loved it. All of it. Not only have I worked with and learned about software. I have also worked with hardware components mainly in the area of IoT devices. I'm familiar with working with Arduinos and creating code for them.

            <p class="project-description">Scavenger Hunt is a 3D first person game. Where the objective is to locate items that are randomly placed around the map. In the map you will also find portals that will lead you to puzzle rooms which award the player with a bonus item upon successful completion of the puzzle. What makes Scavenger Hunt interesting is it is also a procedurally generated game meaning the map generated will almost never be the same twice.</p>
            <p class="project-description">Scavenger Hunt is a year long project I worked on during my senior year of college. My team and I worked alongside a client where I gained exposure to the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). I took lead at the beginning of the project. During this time I established deadlines, assigning tasks, setting up weekly meetings with the client, and drafting reports that would keep the client up to date with any progess on a weekly basis.</p>
            <p class="project-description">I also took lead during the end of the project where I finalized project documentation, established a techonology transfer meeting giving the client the neccessary credentials to continue working on this project, this included giving a through breakdown of the different components of the game and how it worked as a whole.</p>
